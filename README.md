Binder for Julia and Python

## Environment

- Julia Language (v1.5.3)
- Python (by default)

## Configration 

`Project.toml`

> A `Project.toml` (or `JuliaProject.toml`) file can specify both the version of Julia to be used and a list of Julia packages to be installed. If a `Manifest.toml` is present, it will determine the exact versions of the Julia packages that are installed.

`environment.yml`

> `environment.yml` is the standard configuration file used by `conda` that lets you install any kind of package, including `Python`, `R`, and `C/C++` packages. repo2docker does not use your `environment.yml` to create and activate a new conda environment. Rather, it updates a base conda environment defined here with the packages listed in your `environment.yml`. This means that the environment will always have the same default name, not the name specified in your `environment.yml`.
